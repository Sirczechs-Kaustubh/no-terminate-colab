# Prevent Google Colab Runtime from Disconnecting
This repository contains a simple JavaScript code snippet that helps to prevent Google Colabâ€™s runtime from disconnecting. This is particularly useful for long-running machine learning tasks.

## Credit
This code is based on the work of Patrick von Platen from Hugging Face. You can find the original post here.

## Usage
Open Google Colab and start your project.
Open the browserâ€™s console. Hereâ€™s how you can do it in different browsers:
Chrome: Right click anywhere on the page and select Inspect, then click on Console.
Firefox: Right click anywhere on the page and select Inspect Element, then click on Console.
Copy the following code and paste it into the console, then press Enter:

```
function ConnectButton(){
    console.log("Connect pushed"); 
    document.querySelector("#top-toolbar > colab-connect-button").shadowRoot.querySelector("#connect").click() 
}

var colab = setInterval(ConnectButton,60000);
```

This code will automatically click the Connect button every minute, which should prevent the Colab runtime from disconnecting due to inactivity.

## Stopping the Code
If you want to stop the code from running, you can use the clearInterval() function. Uncomment the following line and run it in the console:

```
clearInterval(colab)
```

This will stop the automatic clicking of the Connect button.
